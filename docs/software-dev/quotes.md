# Scrum Master

## A day in the life of a Scrum Master:

* Start the day with an <span style="color: yellow">open and curious mind</span> (and in my case some good coffee)
* A good first question to consider is <span style="color: yellow">"How can I improve the life of the Scrum Team by facilitating creativity and empowerment?" </span>
* Remember: <span style="color: yellow">your agenda is as good as empty!</span> Except for the Daily Scrum and maybe some other Scrum events
* You attend the Daily Scrum as an observer. <span style="color: yellow">You listen to what is and isn't being said.
* You <span style="color: yellow">consider some of the questions</span> I've mentioned earlier.
* Based on your observations you determine your next steps. This might be <span style="color: yellow">coaching, consulting, teaching, facilitating, mentoring, managing, problem-solving, conflict navigating </span> or... just sitting with the team, listening, and watching the team.
* <span style="color: yellow">Doing "nothing" is a perfect activity for a Scrum Master! </span> The biggest pitfall for a Scrum Master is being too busy and not noticing what is really going on.

As a daily preparation a Scrum Master could consider questions like:

- How is my Product Owner doing?
    - Is the Product Backlog in shape?
    - How is he/she managing the stakeholders?
    - What about delivering business value and return-on-investment?
- How is the Scrum Team doing?
    - Are they working together?
    - Is there conflict in the team, do they resolve that?
    - Is the team making decisions?
- How are our engineering practices doing?
    - Is the team caring and improving them?
    - How is the test automation?
    - Is the team expanding their Definition of Done?
- How is my organization doing?
    - Is there inter-team coordination?
    - What organizational impediments are in the way?
    - What about the HR practices?

## The 8 Stances of a Scrum Master


* An **Impediment Remover** that helps resolve issues that are blocking the team’s progress, taking into account the self-organising capabilities of the Development Team;
* A **Facilitator** that sets the stage and provides clear boundaries in which the team can collaborate. This includes facilitation of the Scrum events to ensure they’ll achieve the desired outcome and - most importantly - that the empirical process is optimized;
* A **Coach** that helps individuals and groups to continuously improve in how they deliver valuable outcomes as a team or as an organization;
* A **Teacher** that ensures that Scrum and relevant techniques are well-understood and enacted;
* A **Servant Leader** that creates environments where teams can work effectively with stakeholders to create valuable outcomes;
* A **Manager** that is responsible for managing (true) impediments, eliminating waste, managing the process, managing the team’s health, managing the boundaries of self-organisation, and managing the culture;
* A **Change Agent** that helps to enable a culture in which Scrum Teams can flourish - on every level of the organization;
* A **Mentor** that transfers agile knowledge and experience to the team.

## Common

Scrum Masters use an **“inside out”** approach, Agile Coaches use an **“outside in”** approach
